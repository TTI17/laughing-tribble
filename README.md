# üëΩValorant Peak Bot

## Description
This bot will be useful for those who are in a party
and cannot decide who to pick.
This bot generates three agent pick options for each map.
The bot has inline buttons for more convenient selection of maps

## Additionally
Valorant Peak is still in development and may have some bugs, such as it may issue the same agents on the same map.
Therefore, I will be very glad if you offer your ideas for future bot development.
